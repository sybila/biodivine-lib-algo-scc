Additionally, the regulatory graph was modified to ensure consistency with the update functions:\n\n - Regulation `Orf3b (sa356) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `Orf8 (sa355) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `Nsp3 (sa349) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.\n\n",
