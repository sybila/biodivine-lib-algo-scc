    "notes": "### Availability\n\nThe model is given as a `.booleannet` file in the supplement of the paper. However, here we use the \nversion available in the \"GRN principles\" dataset as it is already translated to a machine-readable\nformat. The format is then translated to `.bnet` using `rules_to_bnet.py` script.\n\nSince the model also contains a lot of logical issues, the files is then translated from `.bnet`\nto `.aeon`, where we can add annotations to indicate that these are accounted for.\n\n### Modifications\n\nThe following modifications were made to make the model logically consistent with it's regulatory graph:\n\n - Regulation `ATF2_T -> AP1_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CRE_T -> AP1_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_ERK1_2_T -> AP1_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_P38_T -> AP1_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `JNK_T -> BAD_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `BCLX_S_T -> BCLX_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CALCIPRESSIN_T -> CALCINEURIN_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `VAV_T -> CAM_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `FASLS_T -> FASL_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CBL_T -> FYN_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD45_T -> FYN_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IKK_ALPHA_T -> IKB_ALPHA_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `ETS_T -> IL2_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IFN_GAMMA_T -> IL2_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IL4_SHORT_T -> IL4_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_NFKB_T -> IL6_DELTA4_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_NFKB_T -> IL6_NATIVE_T` set as non-essential. \n - Regulation `IL6_DELTA4_T -> IL6_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CBL_T -> LCK_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD28_T -> LCK_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD45_T -> LCK_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CABIN1_T -> MEF2_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `HDAC_T -> MEF2_T` set as non-essential. \n - Regulation `PKC_T -> NCK_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `BCL10_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CARMA1_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IKK_ALPHA_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IKK_GAMMA_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `MALT1_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `OX40L -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `OX40_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `PKC_THETA_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `RIP1_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TRAF2_T -> NFKB_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD40 -> NUC_ERK1_2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `FC_GAMMAR -> NUC_ERK1_2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IGG -> NUC_ERK1_2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TRAF6 -> NUC_ERK1_2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD40 -> NUC_P38` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TRAF2 -> NUC_P38` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TRAF3 -> NUC_P38` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TRAF5 -> NUC_P38` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `GRB7_T -> RAS_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NCK_plus_SOS_T -> RAS_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHC_plus_GRB2_plus_SOS_T -> RAS_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHP1_plus_GRB2_plus_SOS_T -> RAS_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHP2_plus_GRB2_plus_GAB1_plus_SOS_T -> RAS_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IL12 -> STAT4_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IL12R_T -> STAT4_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `LYP_T -> ZAP70_T` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `VAV_T -> ZAP70_T` set as non-essential.\n\n\n\n",
