### Modifications

The regulatory graph was modified to ensure consistency with the update functions:

 - Regulation `CDK2 (S_41) -> pRB (S_8)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `Prot (S_23) -> pNFKB (S_48)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `Prot (S_23) -> p53 (S_51)` sign set to `unknown`.
 - Regulation `IKK (S_20) -> pSTAT3 (S_66)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `JNK (S_31) -> pSTAT3 (S_66)` marked as non-essential.
