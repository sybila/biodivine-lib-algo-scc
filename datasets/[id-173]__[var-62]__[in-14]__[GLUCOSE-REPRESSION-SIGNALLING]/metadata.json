    "notes": "### Modifications\n\nThe model is published as a list of reactions from which the logical update rules are constructed. Note that in some reactions, the authors assume \"multi-valued\" species, but state that it is not clear how this should be reflected in the network and there isn't a clear formal \"semantics\" for this aspect of the model. As such, we only consider a Boolean abstraction of the published reactions. Also, the regulation monotonicity could be reconstructed from the presented regulatory graph, but the logical rules are constructed algorithmically from this graph, so there shouldn't be any reason to include them (they can be safely inferred).",
