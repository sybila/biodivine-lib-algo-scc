### Modifications

The identity update functions of the following variables are erased, since they are effectively inputs: `ANXA2 (S_59)`, `BMI1 (S_91)`, `CD74 (S_35)`, `CD81 (S_74)`, `CHST2 (S_16)`, `CNR1 (S_45)`, `CREM (S_3)`, `CSDA (S_83)`, `CSNK2A2 (S_70)`, `CUL5 (S_85)`, `EED (S_60)`, `FGFR1 (S_53)`, `FRK (S_12)`, `FYN (S_80)`, `GSK3B (S_62)`, `HSP90AA1 (S_5)`, `IL10RA (S_50)`, `LMNA (S_63)`, `RFC5 (S_76)`, `RRM1 (S_75)`, `SIAH1 (S_29)`, `SKI (S_14)`, `TCF3 (S_1)`, `TGFBR3 (S_61)`, `TNFRSF1B (S_26)`.

Additionally, the regulatory graph was modified to ensure consistency with the update functions:

 - Regulation `CD79A (S_41) -> AICDA (S_7)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `CD27 (S_84) -> AICDA (S_7)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `EED (S_60) -> EZH2 (S_11)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TGFBR3 (S_61) -> CAV1 (S_33)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TNF (S_51) -> ADM (S_43)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `IGF1R (S_73) -> INPP5D (S_44)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `IFNGR2 (S_13) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `RRM1 (S_75) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `ADM (S_43) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `ILK (S_36) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `AEBP1 (S_65) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `FRK (S_12) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `BMI1 (S_91) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `EGR1 (S_42) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `INPP5D (S_44) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TNF (S_51) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `CSNK2A2 (S_70) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TGFBR3 (S_61) -> PTEN (S_56)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `CREM (S_3) -> FOS (S_57)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `CNR1 (S_45) -> FOS (S_57)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `PCNA (S_17) -> FOS (S_57)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `IFNGR2 (S_13) -> APOBEC3G (S_58)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `IFNGR2 (S_13) -> IL7 (S_66)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TNF (S_51) -> PRF1 (S_82)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `TGFBR3 (S_61) -> ALOX5 (S_86)` marked as non-essential.
