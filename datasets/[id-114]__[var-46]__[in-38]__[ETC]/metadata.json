Additionally, the regulatory graph was modified to ensure consistency with the update functions:\n\n - Regulation `O_2__simple_molecule (sa24) -> H__ion_mitochondrion (sa18)` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `sa13_Cyt_C_mitochondrial_matrix (sa13) -> H__ion_mitochondrion (sa18)` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `sa255_QH_2__simple_molecule_mitochondrial_matrix (sa255) -> H__ion_mitochondrion (sa18)` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `paraquat_simple_molecule (sa397) -> superoxide_simple_molecule (sa354)` marked as non-essential.\n",
