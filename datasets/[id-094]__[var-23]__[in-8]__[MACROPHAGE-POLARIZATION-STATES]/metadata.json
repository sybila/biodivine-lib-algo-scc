As such, these were also added, resulting in an `.aeon` file.\n\nThe following regulations were also added because they are missing in the published list (some are visible in the main figure though - hence we know their monotonicity):\n - `IL1b -> IL1R`\n - `IL1b_e -> IL1R`\n - `IL10_out -> IL10R`\n - `PPARg -? PPARg`\n - `STAT6 -? STAT6`\n - `JMJD3 -? JMJD3`\n - `STAT3 -? STAT3`\n - `ERK -? ERK`\n\nFinally, two regulations turned out to be non-essential:\n - Regulation `IL16_e -> IL1R` marked as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IL1b_e -> FcgR` marked as non-essential.",
