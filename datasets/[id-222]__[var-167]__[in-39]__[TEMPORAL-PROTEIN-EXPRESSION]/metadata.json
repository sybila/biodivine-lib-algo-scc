In order to be able to properly annotate the logical errors, we then \ncovert the model to `.aeon`.\n\n### Modifications\n\nThe following regulations were updated to fix logical inconsistencies:\n \n - Regulation `ATF2 -> AP1` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CRE -> AP1` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_ERK1_2 -> AP1` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NUC_P38 -> AP1` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `JNK -> BAD` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CALCIPRESSIN -> CALCINEURIN` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `VAV -> CAM` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CBL -> FYN` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD45 -> FYN` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `AP1 -> GM_CSF` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IKK_GAMMA -> IKB_BETA` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `TAK1_TAB -> IKK_GAMMA` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `ETS -> IL2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `GSK3_BETA -> IL2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `GSK3_BETA -> IL4` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CBL -> LCK` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD28 -> LCK` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CD45 -> LCK` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `CABIN1 -> MEF2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `HDAC -> MEF2` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `PKC -> NCK` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `GSK3_BETA -> NUC_NFAT` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `IL1 -> NUC_NFKB` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `GRB7 -> RAS` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `NCK_SOS -> RAS` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHC_GRB2_SOS -> RAS` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHP1_GRB2_SOS -> RAS` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `SHP2_GRB2_GAB1_SOS -> RAS` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `LYP -> ZAP70` set as non-essential.\n - Regulation `VAV -> ZAP70` set as non-essential.",
