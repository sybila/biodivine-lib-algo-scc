 - Keywords: grn-principles, curated


### Availability

The rules are available in a supplementary document, but they have been already extracted in the `grn-principles` dataset,
hence we use these values and translate them to `.bnet` using `rules_to_bnet.py`.

### Modifications

The model is provided without modifications.
