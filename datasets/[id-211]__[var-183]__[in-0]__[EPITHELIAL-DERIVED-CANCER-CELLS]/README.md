### Modifications

The model is based on automatic translation from the `.sif` regulatory network using the process described in the paper. This model is an extension of model no. 210, where the the translation algorithm is implemented using a Python script. Note that the original regulation file contained two instances of the `MAPK14 -> DUSP1` regulation, one of which was removed.
