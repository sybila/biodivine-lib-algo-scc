### Modifications

The model is provided without major modifications, only constant variables `ABA`, `ABH1`, `ARP_Complex`, `CPK23`, `CPK6`, `DAGK`, `ERA1`, `GAPC12`, `GCR1`, `GEF`, `GTP`, `MRP5`, `NADPH`, `Nitrite`, `NtSyp121`, `PC`, `PtdInsP3`, `PtdInsP4`, `RCN1`, `SCAB1`, `SPP1`, and `Sph` were turned into canonical inputs.
